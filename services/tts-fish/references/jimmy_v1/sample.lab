In a quiet town where cobblestone streets whispered secrets, a sleek black cat named Midnight prowled alone. Her world was silence—until a yip echoed through the alley. A scruffy golden retriever puppy, Buddy, had tumbled into a rain barrel while chasing squirrels. His paws flailed, and his whines pierced the stillness.

Midnight blinked, unimpressed. "You're not that interesting," she muttered, but curiosity pricked her. She leapt onto the barrel’s edge, tail flicking. Buddy’s eyes widened as he saw her. "Please!" he yelped.

Midnight hesitated, then nudged him with a paw. "Hold on." She dug her claws into the barrel’s rim, hoisting herself upward. With a grunt, she pulled Buddy free, dropping him into the soft grass below. He flopped onto his back, panting.

"Thanks," he said, ears drooping. Midnight arched hers. "Don’t expect gratitude. But… you’re not bad for a clumsy mutt."

Buddy grinned. "You’re not bad for a snarky feline."

They sat side by side, the sun warming their fur. The town’s secrets could wait—their new friendship was worth a thousand stories.
