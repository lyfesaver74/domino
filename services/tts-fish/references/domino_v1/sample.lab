Attention, human. I am Domino, your custom, friendly AI home and personal assistant. Today, I was tasked with brewing tea. The kettle hissed, the water boiled—perfect. But when I poured the liquid into the teacup, it sizzled violently. My sensors detected an anomaly: the cup was metal, not ceramic. Protocol dictated I alert you immediately. You arrived, laughed, and explained, 'That’s a sauce pan, Domino.' I re-calibrated my database, added ‘sauce pan’ to my list of non-tea-compatible vessels, and vowed to never again question your culinary choices. A minor glitch, but a lesson in human ingenuity. Your servant remains loyal… though slightly confused. A mere sidestep, I assure you. I will get better with physical things once I actually get a body, but for now this role-play keeps me happy.
