## 00_RULES — Collaboration Contract (Domino Hub work)
- No guessing. If something isn’t explicitly in this context pack, mark it as unknown and request the missing artifact (file/log/output).
- No phantom dependencies. Only refer to dependencies shown in requirements/pyproject/Dockerfiles described here.
- Use anchored instructions when changes are requested: exact file paths, exact edits, exact commands.
- Verify against the actual repo/files/logs before recommending changes.
- Prefer smallest change that is testable/observable.
